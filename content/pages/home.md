## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Questions We Hear Most Often

**How much does a typical home repair cost in the Orlando area?**

Home repair pricing in Orlando varies based on the project size and materials. Small fixes like faucet leaks or outlet replacements typically range from $150–$300. Larger repairs such as drywall restoration, light carpentry, or water-damage repair generally cost $300–$1,500. We always provide a clear, itemized estimate before any work begins.

**How quickly can you respond to home, marine, or RV repair requests?**

We typically respond within 2-4 hours during business hours (every day 8 AM - 8 PM). For emergency repairs, we provide 24/7 response. Send us photos on Facebook Messenger for the fastest assessment.

**Do you offer warranties on your repair work?**

Yes. All home, marine, and RV repairs include a workmanship warranty. If anything doesn't look right after the job is completed, we'll return to make it right.

**Can you handle both small repairs and larger restoration projects?**

Yes — we handle everything from small handyman repairs to larger restoration work for homes, boats, and RVs. Whether it's a minor fixture issue or more complex structural or moisture-related repairs, we provide precise, dependable service. Explore our [home repair services](/home-repairs) and [marine & RV services](/marine-rv) for details.

**Do I need to be home during the repair appointment?**

For most home or RV repairs, you can choose whether to be home. If access can be arranged safely, we can complete many repairs without requiring you to be present. For marine repairs, we typically coordinate access directly at the marina or storage location.

**What if the repair issue is worse than it first appears?**

If we discover additional damage during the repair, we'll explain the issue, provide photos, and give an updated estimate before continuing. Whether it's [home repairs](/home-repairs), [marine work](/marine-rv), or RV restoration — no surprise charges and no work is done without your approval.

**How do I know which repairs to prioritize for my home, boat, or RV?**

During our initial assessment, we help you understand which repairs are urgent (safety or water-damage risks), important (preventing further deterioration), and optional (aesthetic or improvement-focused). We provide clear recommendations based on your budget and goals.

**Do you offer same-day or emergency repair services in Orlando?**

We offer limited same-day and urgent repair services depending on the project and schedule. Send details or photos on Facebook Messenger for the quickest availability check.

**What types of marine repair services do you provide in Orlando?**

We handle gelcoat repairs, deck and interior restoration, electrical diagnostics, moisture checks, and engine-adjacent troubleshooting. Send photos and details, and we'll provide a clear estimate for your vessel.

**What types of RV repairs do you handle?**

We repair RV electrical systems, lighting, leaks, cabinet or wall damage, soft spots, water-damage issues, and interior restoration. Our service is fully mobile across Orlando and surrounding areas.
