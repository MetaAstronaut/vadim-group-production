This guide covers the **10 most common home repair issues in Florida**, how to recognize early warning signs, DIY steps you can safely take, and when it's time to call a professional.

## 1. Drywall Cracks (Especially Near Doors and Windows)

### **Why it happens in Florida**
- Natural home settling  
- Shifting soil and slab movement  
- High humidity causing expansion and contraction  

### **Early warning signs**
- Hairline cracks spreading from door frames  
- Gaps between baseboards and walls  
- Cracks reappearing after patching  

### **DIY fix**
Small cracks under **1/8 inch** → spackle + sanding.

### **Call a pro if:**
- Cracks wider than 1/4 inch  
- Repeated cracking  
- “V-shaped” cracks above doors  
- Multiple cracks throughout the house  

These may signal structural or moisture issues.

---

## 2. Water Stains on Ceilings and Walls

### **Common causes**
- Roof leaks  
- Clogged gutters  
- AC condensation line overflow  
- Plumbing in the attic  

### **Why it's serious**
Even small stains can lead to:
- Mold growth  
- Sagging ceilings  
- Wood rot  
- Electrical hazards  

### **Call a pro if:**
- The stain grows in size  
- Ceiling feels soft  
- You smell mustiness  

---

## 3. Mold & Mildew Growth

Florida humidity often exceeds **70%**, creating ideal conditions for mold.

### **Where it typically appears**
- Bathroom ceilings  
- Window frames  
- Closets and cabinets  
- AC closets  
- Behind furniture  

### **Prevention tips**
- Maintain indoor humidity **45–55%**  
- Keep AC drain lines clean  
- Use bathroom fans  
- Inspect areas with limited airflow  

### **Call a pro if:**
- Mold returns after cleaning  
- You see black or green patches  
- Anyone at home experiences allergies  

---

## 4. Damaged Caulking & Failed Window Seals

### **Florida climate impact**
UV exposure + humidity breaks down caulking quickly.

### **Why it matters**
- Higher energy bills  
- Moisture entry  
- Mold around windows  
- Drafts  

### **Fix**
Remove old caulk → clean → reapply exterior-grade caulk.

---

## 5. Door Misalignment & Hard-to-Close Doors

### **Causes**
- House settling  
- Humidity swelling door frames  
- Loose hinge screws  

### **Warning signs**
- Door scrapes at the top  
- New gaps between door frame and wall  
- Door suddenly won’t latch  

This may indicate foundation movement or excessive moisture.

---

## 6. Cracked or Loose Floor Tiles

### **Causes**
- Concrete slab shift  
- Water damage underneath  
- Incorrect original installation  

### **Warning signs**
- Hollow sound when tapping tiles  
- Multiple cracks forming a pattern  

This may require subfloor inspection.

---

## 7. Exterior Paint Peeling (UV + Humidity Damage)

Florida sun destroys low-quality paint fast.

### **Signs you need repainting**
- Chalky surface texture  
- Fading color  
- Bubbles or blisters  
- Cracked paint around trim  

New paint = waterproof barrier + higher energy efficiency.

---

## 8. HVAC Strain & Cooling Issues

### **Most common Florida AC complaints**
- Weak airflow  
- AC runs constantly  
- High electric bills  
- Hot spots in the house  

### **DIY checklist**
- Replace filters monthly  
- Clean AC drain lines  
- Remove debris from outdoor unit  

### **Call a pro if:**
- AC leaks water  
- Foul smell from vents  
- AC shuts off intermittently  

---

## 9. Wood Rot in Exterior Trim & Decks

### **Where it happens**
- Fascia boards  
- Soffits  
- Porch framing  
- Decking  

### **Early warning signs**
- Soft or spongy wood  
- Bubbled paint  
- Insect activity  

Wood rot spreads fast — repair early.

---

## 10. Storm Damage (Wind, Rain, Debris)

### **Florida storm impacts**
- Loose siding  
- Damaged gutters  
- Missing roof shingles  
- Window leaks  
- Water intrusion in walls  

### **After every strong storm**
Do a quick inspection:
- Check roof from the ground

- Look for new water spots  
- Clear gutters
